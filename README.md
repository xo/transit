# transit

`transit` is a pure Go port of [tree-sitter][ts]. tree-sitter is a parser
generator and an incremental parsing library. It builds a concrete syntax tree
of a source file, and it updates the tree after an edit without parsing the
whole file again. Editors use it to highlight code and to find structure in
code.

transit exists to serve two `xo` projects. [rline][rline] uses it to
highlight syntax as the user types, and [usql][usql] uses it to complete from
the context at the cursor. transit gives parsing information only.

Every Go package for tree-sitter today uses cgo, and a program that imports
one needs a C compiler for each target. A program that imports transit needs
the Go toolchain and nothing else.

## Status

The generator and its C backend are ported. They write the golden `parser.c`
and `node-types.json` of all 185 grammars of the set byte for byte, and on
2026-09-29 the gate of D9 holds: 151 grammars count, which ends phase 2.
Phase 1 ends when Ken accepts the target API in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md)
(D54). Phase 3 ported the runtime: the parser, the tree, the node and the
tree cursor. The Go runtime gives the same tree as the C runtime for every
corpus input of every fixture grammar. It parses with the tables and the
lexers of C grammars, through the test module, because the Go backend that
writes Go grammars is not written yet. The query engine is not ported yet.
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) holds the plan, and the decisions record every
answer that shapes it.

## Grammars

transit has no grammars yet. [docs/GRAMMAR.md](docs/GRAMMAR.md) says how a
grammar is added, and this section will list each one with its upstream
repository and tag.

## Differences from upstream

transit has no deliberate difference from upstream tree-sitter.
[docs/UPSTREAM.md](docs/UPSTREAM.md) says when one can be made. This section
will list each one with its decision.

## License

transit is under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). Upstream
tree-sitter is under the MIT license too, and `LICENSE` keeps its copyright
line. Each grammar keeps the license of its own repository.
