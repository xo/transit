# Backlog

This document lists work that is known and not done. Each item names the
decision or the question that found it.

A decision is not a backlog item. It goes in [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md).
A question for Ken goes at the end of [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md), under Open
questions for Ken. When an item here is done, delete it, and record in
`decisions/` anything that was decided on the way (dbmeta D110).

## Units in progress

An agent claims a unit of port work here before it starts, with the unit, the
agent and the date, and deletes the claim when Ken commits the unit (D50, D61).

| Unit | Agent | Date |

## The generator

### Port the log of the generator

Upstream writes log lines with `debug!` and `info!` in `build_tables/`, and
`report_state_info` in `build_tables.rs` writes the parse states of one rule
for the option `--report-states-for-rule` of the tool. The generator has no
logger yet, so the port leaves them out. The generator logs with `log/slog`
(D67). Add the logger to the options, then port the lines,
`report_state_info` and `--report-states-for-rule`. Some functions of
`build_lex_table.go` then take the `StrPool` again, as upstream does.

## The runtime

### Port the tests of the runtime

`crates/cli/src/tests` of upstream tests the runtime on real grammars:
`parser_test.rs`, `tree_test.rs`, `node_test.rs`, `corpus_test.rs` and
`pathological_test.rs`. The package `test/cgrammar` loads the fixture
grammars, and `language_test.go` there ports `language_test.rs`. Port the
other files there too (D35). `corpus_test.rs` adds random edits of each
corpus input, which the edit test of `test/cgrammar` does only once for each
input. Compare the trees at ABI 14 too, from the `src/parser.c` of each
grammar.

### Compare the decoders with the C decoders

[`UPSTREAM.md`](UPSTREAM.md) says that the test of the decoder compares the
Go decoders with the C decoders for every sequence of up to four bytes, in
the test module. The tests of `lexer.go` compare `decodeUTF8` with the
maximal subpart of the Unicode standard, which ICU follows, and they test the
UTF-16 decoders case by case. Add the comparison with `U8_NEXT` and
`U16_NEXT` of C when the test module can call the decoders of the runtime.

## The setup of the repository

These items come in phase 1 and later, as the plan says.

### Add the tests of the port rules

[`UPSTREAM.md`](UPSTREAM.md) and [`GRAMMAR.md`](GRAMMAR.md) name tests that
hold their rules:

1. Each folder in `grammars/` has an entry in `grammars/grammars.json`, and
   each entry has a folder.
2. Each ported function has a doc comment that names its C function or its
   Rust function.
